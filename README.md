# Background of this project

After nearly 20 years paying $20 a month for hosting because I was too lazy to remove old sites and contact clients to see what to do, I finally decided it was time to leave Mediatemple.

Having changed a lot myself I was thinking I might just create a simple minimal site with the old content and let that be the end of it, saving myself $20 a month.

As a front end developer trying to figure out what to use to build this minimal page I figured it might be good to just try some of the technologies I wanted to play with for a while.

Since it is basically impossible to settle on one technology I thought maybe it could be something else.. A (probably soon to be deserted) playground.

So the outline of this project is, try out a bunch of different technologies and somehow weave them into a single application.

To start this off I am trying out [TurboRepo](https://turborepo.org/). I tried [Nx](https://nx.dev) for another prototype at work and really liked it in theory but wanted a point of comparison. I'm not sure I'm settled on TurboRepo right now but for the beginning why not.

The other part of this is, what could a blog/website look like if the goal wasn't consistency but diversity? For that I think it might be interesting to try different tech on the same or similar content.

More concretely I think treating each experiment like a blog post, somthing like [literate coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) where an experiment can just be something simple like a version of the page with different styles or fonts, maybe some controls for the user to adjust the layout, to more complete blog-like content writing up the experiment and any findings and opinions.

Ultimately I guess it's just a literal home page. A place to put my experiments and experiences. Connecting interests, hypertext like the web was meant to be. My own little slice of the metaverse. I may not be able to upload myself to the cloud but I can create something like it.

Finally I suppose I don't expect this will last long. I'll probably make a couple of simple experiments and then leave it for another 10 years, but maybe it can be something different this time.. lets find out.
