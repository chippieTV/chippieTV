With 5 locations, 3 in Soho, 1 in Somerset House and the newly opened South Kensington, they are set to take over the world, one carefully crafted independent shop at a time. Their obsession with quality and aesthetic of classy serenity without pretention makes F&W one of my favourite places to get a coffee in London, and I'm not alone. The website had to have the right mix of style, texture and life as the locations to do them justice. The site is simple and uncluttered, a faded out photograph of the inside of a cup of filter coffee serves as the background for the top, slightly beigey brown with a soft ceramic reflection. Being half Swedish I grew up to love black coffee. I originally met Jorge Fernandez maybe 12 years ago when he was manager of Monmouth Coffee, which for a long time was my favourite coffee shop in London, beans freshly roasted from all over the world, this place really introduced me properly to the larger world of coffee. When I heard Jorge was leaving to start up on his own I had to see what this new place was.. it was Fernandez and Wells. The coffee cup that was photographed for the top banner is a 'Spisa Ribb' from Gustavsberg - my mum's home town. The cups were produced in the 1950s and are still my favorite cups to this day. Perhaps that personal touch for me is what Fernandez and Wells is all about. Loving your craft..",
