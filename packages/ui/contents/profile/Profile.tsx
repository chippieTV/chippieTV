        <p>In 2013 I moved to Tokyo where I currently work at <a href="https://www.axelspace.com/en/">Axelspace</a>, a satellite company where we design, build and launch satellites. Part of my work involves web design and user side web development, using React, Typescript and a number of other modern web technologies. I also work on the development of the image processing pipeline for preparing satellite image data for customer use.</p>
        <p>Previous to Axelspace I worked DMM.com as front end engineer for around 4 years.</p>
        <p>Before moving to Japan I spent 10+ years as a freelancer in London, where I gathered broad experience, working with clients on tech and web projects, and graphics and print. My university background was originally in mens fashion design, so I naturally started providing design services to fashion related clients, including a few Royal Warrant holders (companies endorsed by the British Royal Family). I have also worked in a few creative agencies on large-client projects for Sony, Coke, Unilever, Fiat, and for individuals, artists, designers and small business owners. My design background means I think visually but I enjoy technical challenges and aim to pursue more technical work over pure design. </p>
        <p>I have used Photoshop and Illustrator for 20 or so years, been playing with HTML since the late 90s.. These days my daily work life is split between planning how best to serve users, building prototypes and writing production code, or on the command line hacking together bash scripts.</p>
        <p>One notable experience, in 2011/12 for 9 months I was the sole technical and design lead of an online service startup, and although the startup wasn't successful it was a painful but amazing experience.</p>
        <p>I have taken part in a couple of hackathons, one in London where our team won with 'last sandwich'.. a service to help food retailers connect with customers at the end of the day to reduce food waste. Another fashion technology related hackathon at Google in Tokyo with Hearst.</p>
        <p>Skills/Specialties: Idea to implementation, problem solving, front end development, API mockups - JavaScript, AJAX, HTML & CSS, PHP, Photoshop & Illustrator.</p>
        <p>I am always studying to broaden my knowledge, I have and plan to continue working my way through a number of udacity.com courses on computer science, machine learning and statistics.</p>
        <p>My wife is from Tokyo, and I have been studying Japanese for a number of years.</p>
